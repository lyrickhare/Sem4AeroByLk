With regards to tutorial 1 question 9, we had to evaluate an expression of the form:


a-b+c+d where a,b,c,d are all positive. 


So if nothing is specified the default order to be used for evaluation is :


(a+(-b+(c+d)))


In general also, The order is from right to left. If the function is a sum of the terms like
5 sin(x)²x³

then we compute

5(sin(x)[sin(x)(x[x *x])]).

The addition is also from right to left. Add the two right-most terms, add the third one to this sum, and so on.
